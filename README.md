# High-School-Java-Works
Consists of my work I have done during my AP Computer Science class in High School

Table of context:
AscendDescend.java - a program that prints out a list of an even number of given names in both Ascending and Descending order in two columns

ArrayListGlitch.java - a program that creates an ArrayList called numoptions which contains numbers 1 to 9, and an ArrayList called arylst which starts off blank. The program will remove a random number from the numoptions ArrayList and add that number on to the arylst ArrayList. Once that number has been placed inot the arylst, it is removed from the numoptions array and replaced with a zero. The program con         Utilizes ArrayLists
