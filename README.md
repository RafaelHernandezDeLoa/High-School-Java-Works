# High-School-Java-Works
Consists of some of the work I have done during my AP Computer Science class in High School

Table of context:

AscendDescend.java - a program that prints out a list of an even number of given names in both Ascending and Descending order in two columns

ArrayListGlitch.java - a program that creates an ArrayList called numoptions which contains numbers 1 to 9, and an ArrayList called arylst which starts off blank. The program will remove a random number from the numoptions ArrayList and add that number on to the arylst ArrayList. Once that number has been placed into the arylst, it is removed from the numoptions array and replaced with a zero. This, effectively, creates an array of the numbers 1 to 9 in a random order. The second half of the program shows us a version of this array but with all the odd numbers removed from it.

DoubleEmFromFile.java - This program accesses a file from the filepath mentioned in it and reads it. Afterwards, the program prints out the contents of the file onto the terminal but with numberical values doubled that of what it was originally in the document.

Lab14b.java - For this program, I used a series of for loops and if statements to figure out, based on the current given int array called nums, if the numbers in the array are all in ascending or descending order.

SmallestCommonNumber.java - From two ordered arrays of nonrepeatitive integers (nums1 and nums2), the program finds the smallest common number between the two arrays. The lowestCommon1 method achieves this in a slower than necessary way while the lowestCommon2 method does the same thing through a less computationally heavy procedure.
